# Nx2pt Emulator

Building Nx2pt emulators to accelerate cosmological inference pipeline. 

- Typical computation time for a 10x2 point data vector in CosmoLike takes ~ 2.6 s.

- The computation time for a 10x2 point data vector from neural network based emulator ~ 1.1 ms, which is O(10^3) improvement.
